# fair-map

TODO:
* The user should be able to add a batch of images from their device that are geotagged. We should import these images, save them to the backend as markers, and display them to the map. If a marker has an image and no title, simply display an image icon next to it instead of the name
* Let's move the satellite layer to image layers panel and make it toggleable just like the others (default to on). We can remove the redundant button from the bottom bar
